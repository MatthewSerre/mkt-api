# Mario Kart Tour API

Mario Kart Tour API aims to be a robust resource for developers to leverage when creating applications or websites related to the popular Mario Kart Tour mobile game.  This project is a work in progress, so feel free to suggest or make improvements.  See https://mario-kart-tour-api.herokuapp.com for documentation and examples.

## To Do

- Add data~~/endpoints~~ for karts, gliders~~, and courses~~
- Host images of/add image links for the drivers, driver emblems, karts, gliders, and courses (need to identify the best place to source the files to avoid any infringement)
- Implement error handling/messages
- Add throttling~~/API key system~~ if necessary
- ~~Add Daily Select data to drivers (and possibly All Clear Pipe attribute if items are never removed from it)~~

Please contact me if you would be willing to help with gathering/inputting data to seed the database!
